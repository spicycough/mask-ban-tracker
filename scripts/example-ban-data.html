  (enacted in June 2024, to take effect in October) —
  <em>general ban with exemptions</em>
</p>

<p>
  Five state laws make it illegal to mask in various public and private
  settings, with the current law offering exemptions for holidays, theater,
  trades, motorcycles, and “any person wearing a medical or surgical device for
  the purpose of preventing the spread of contagious disease.” The law requires
  removal of a mask if ordered by law enforcement under any circumstances and by
  “owner or occupant” of a “public or private property.”&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Note:</span> The pre-COVID law had a
  stronger medical exemption: “for the purpose of ensuring the physical health
  or safety of the wearer or others.” And it only permitted police to request
  mask removal at a traffic stop or when they believed a crime was taking place.
